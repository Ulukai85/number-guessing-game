# Number Guessing Game
## Project for Course "Relational Database"
### freeCodeCamp.org

In this program the player is asked for their name and has to guess a random number between 1 and 1000. The player data is stored into a database, that is implemented with postgreSQL.

I built this number guessing game to apply the skills I aquired during the [freeCodeCamp-Course "Relational Database"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-number-guessing-game-project/build-a-number-guessing-game). The specifications to successfully pass the tests are here: [TUTORIAL.md](https://github.com/Ulukai85/number-guessing-game/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md).
I produced [this bash script](https://github.com/Ulukai85/number-guessing-game/blob/main/number_guess.sh) to implement the logic and [this SQL-Database](https://github.com/Ulukai85/number-guessing-game/blob/main/number_guess.sql) to store the players and the game data.
